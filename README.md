# Python Basics

This repo is my personal practice space for learning Python. Here I'm saving exercises and small examples from my Python fundamentals course. It's mostly stuff I want to remember and practice.  

## What I’ve Learned So Far

- **Variables & Data Types:** Integers, floats, strings, booleans… the basics.  
- **Operators:** Arithmetic, comparisons, and logical operators.  
- **Control Flow:** `if`, `elif`, `else` and loops (`for` and `while`).  
- **Functions:** How to write them, pass arguments, and return values.  
- **Practice Exercises:** Small problems to get used to the syntax and logic.
